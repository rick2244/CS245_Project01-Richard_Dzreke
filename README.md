# CS245_Project01-Richard_Dzreke
I don't have anything to add. I commented a lot in my source file. This was a hard project to do since I had a hard time thinking of ways to break down the list since I'm not familiar with JSON format CSV files. It was a struggle to come up with effective ways to parse through it, but once I started treating it like a string it was so much easier. After that, the main thing I had to do is make my own sorting algorithms, which weren't too hard since I just adjusted the previous sorting and searching algorithms I did in previous labs, but made their inputs Arraylists.

This program basically serves as an encyclopedia of movies associated with actors. It takes in huge JSON formate CSV files and parses through that data to take relevant data that can be used to output the movies that actors the user wants to search have been in.
