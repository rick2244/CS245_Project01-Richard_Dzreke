# CS245_Project01-Richard_Dzreke
I don't have anything to add. I commented a lot in my source file. This was a hard project to do since I had a hard time thinking of ways to break down the list since I'm not famailier with json format csv files. It was a struggle to come up with effective ways to parse through it, but once I started treating it like a string it was so much easier. After that the main thing I had to do is make my own sorting algorithms, which weren't too hard since I just adjusted the previous sorting and searching algoritms I did in previous labs, but made their inputs Arraylists.
